# Search-Tree-Find
In this project I a map is involved, given that there is a state that connects each other and each has a perspective route with given numbers. In order to run the code you have to put a command like "py find_route.py input1.txt Bremen Kassel". Bremen and Kassel being the states that want to find the quickets and most optimal route. 

With the input Bremen to Kassel this gets outputted
Nodes Popped: 12
Nodes Expanded: 7
Nodes Generated: 20
Distance: 297.0 km
Route:
Bremen to Hannover, 132.0 km
Hannover to Kassel, 165.0 km

As seen it shows the nodes popped, generated, and expaned. The distance is the best distance that the node will go to and the best route.
